# Snippet Parser

A minimal compiler implementation in Go that demonstrates the fundamental stages of compiler design: tokenization, parsing, transformation, and code generation. 

## Overview 🔬

Snippet Parser breaks down the complex process of compilation into simple, understandable steps. It provides a basic framework for understanding how compilers work by implementing core compiler phases:

-  **Tokenizer**: Converts raw input into a stream of tokens
-  **Parser**: Transforms tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
-  **Transformer**: Modifies the AST for code generation
-  **Code Generator**: Converts the transformed AST back into executable code

## Features ✨

-  Supports basic function calls and number literals
-  Demonstrates key compiler design principles
-  Written in pure Go with no external dependencies

## Learning Resources 📖

For those interested in compiler design, this project serves as a starting point to understand:
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax parsing
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Code transformation
- Basic code generation techniques

## Limitations ⚠️

This is a minimal compiler implementation and does not support:
- Complex language features
- Type checking
- Optimization
- Multiple programming languages
- Advanced syntax
